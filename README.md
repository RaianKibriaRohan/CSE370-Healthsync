# CSE370-Healthsync

In this project, we developed Healthsync, a simple yet efficient medical website aimed at improving healthcare management for both doctors and patients. For doctors, Healthsync provides an organized platform to manage patient information, making healthcare delivery more efficient. Patients, on the other hand, can easily select their preferred doctors from trusted clinics, ensuring a smooth and informed decision-making process.
A key challenge in healthcare today is finding blood donors. But Healthsync makes this easier by offering detailed profiles of registered blood donors. This feature helps users quickly locate available donors, reducing the time and effort typically needed in urgent situations.
In summary, Healthsync is a user-friendly online platform that connects patients, doctors, and blood donors, making healthcare processes more accessible and efficient for all.
